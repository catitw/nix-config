# Terminal Emulators

I used to spend a lot of time on terminal emulators, to make them match my taste, but now I found
that it's not worth it, **Zellij can provide a user-friendly and unified user experience for all
terminal emulators! without any pain**!

Currently, I only use the most basic features of terminal emulators, such as true color, graphics
protocol, etc. Other features such as tabs, scrollback buffer, select/search/copy, etc, are all
provided by zellij!

My current terminal emulators are:

1. foot: A fast, lightweight and minimalistic Wayland terminal emulator.
   1. foot only do the things a terminal emulator should do, no more, no less.
   1. It's really suitable for tiling window manager or zellij users!
2. alacritty: A cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator.
   1. alacritty is really fast, I use it as a backup terminal emulator on all my desktops.
